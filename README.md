# Console TO DO LIST!

# As Technical challenge we want you to write your own TODO app.

# # Rules

# It should be a console app. Pure ruby is a plus but feel free to use any gems as you want to make your work done easier.

# # Acceptance criteria

# As a user I should:

# 1. As a user I can add a task
# 2. As a user I can remove task
# 3. As a user I can change the status task (completed)
# 4. As a user I can list all task
# 5. As a user I can list all completed task
# 6. As a user I can list all uncompleted task
# 7. Task list should be stored on disk (file, SQLite, etc.)
# 8. As a user I can turn off and turn app and load previously added tasks.
# 9. Produced software should be well tested.
# 10. Automated review/build process is a plus.
